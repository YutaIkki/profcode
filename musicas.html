    <h4>In my Blood</h4>
    <p>Help me, it's like the walls are caving in<br>
        Sometimes I feel like giving up<br>
        But I just can't<br>
        It isn't in my blood<br>
        <br>
        Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing<br>
        I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something<br>
        I could take to ease my mind slowly<br>
        Just have a drink and you'll feel better<br>
        Just take her home and you'll feel better<br>
        Keep telling me that it gets better<br>
        Does it ever?<br>
        <br>
        Help me, it's like the walls are caving in<br>
        Sometimes I feel like giving up<br>
        No medicine is strong enough<br>
        Someone help me<br>
        I'm crawling in my skin<br>
        Sometimes I feel like giving up<br>
        But I just can't<br>
        <br>
        It isn't in my blood<br>
        It isn't in my blood<br>
        <br>
        I'm looking through my phone again, feeling anxious<br>
        Afraid to be alone again, I hate this<br>
        I'm tryna find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh<br>
        Is there somebody who could help me?<br>
        <br>
        It's like the walls are caving in<br>
        Sometimes I feel like giving up<br>
        No medicine is strong enough<br>

        <br>
        It isn't in my blood<br>
        It isn't in my blood<br>
        <br>
        I need somebody now<br>
        I need somebody now<br>
        Someone to help me out<br>
        I need somebody now<br>
        <br>
        Help me, it's like the walls are caving in<br>

    <h3>Jão</h3>
    <h4>Olhos Vermelhos</h4>
    <p>Descobrindo andar sozinho por aí<br>
        Olha, não é tão difícil assim, meu bem<br>
        A praia era tão linda com você<br>
        Mas praia vazia é boa também<br>
        <br>
        Eu tenho o tronco forte pra me ancorar<br>
        Mas te ver de perto me faz relembrar<br>
        Ninguém disse nada, mas senti no jeito<br>
        Deitado nos teus braços, esperando o fim chegar<br>
        <br>
        Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh<br>
        Faz tempo que eu não vejo hm hm hm<br>
        Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh<br>
        Esses seus olhos vermelhos<br>
        <br>
        Eu, eu quero me perder<br>
        Incendiar, nadar além do mar<br>
        Me deixa sentir medo, tocar tudo que eu vejo<br>
        Não me sorri porque eu venci<br>
        Esses seus olhos vermelhos<br>
        <br>
        Minha vida muda a vida inteira<br>
        Você foi Aquiles e eu na areia<br>
        Alucinações de uma sereia<br>
        Eu corro rápido, mas você sabe me alcançar<br>
        E se o mundo volta<br>
        <br>
        E se o mundo volta<br>
        E se a casa torna<br>
        Me encontra lá fora<br>
        <br>
        Eu, eu quero me perder<br>
        Incendiar, nadar além do mar<br>
        Me deixa sentir medo, tocar tudo que eu vejo<br>
        Não me sorri porque eu venci<br>
        Esses seus olhos vermelhos<br>
        <br>
        Eu corro pra aliviar<br>
        A falta que é navegar em alto mar, incerto<br>
        Eu vou sem saber voar<br>
        Quero cair em direção a água<br>
        De braços abertos, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh<br>
        <br>
        Eu, eu quero me perder<br>
        Incendiar<br>
        <br>]
        Eu, eu quero me perder<br>
        Incendiar<br>
        <br>
        Eu, eu quero me perder<br>
        Incendiar, ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
        <br>

    <h3>Imagine Dragons</h3>
    <h4>Enemy</h4>
    <p>I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows<br>
        For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground<br>
        I'm searching to behold the stories that are told<br>
        When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned<br>
        <br>
        Tell you you're the greatest<br>
        But once you turn, they hate us<br>
        <br>
        Oh, the misery<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        Spare the sympathy<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        (Look out for yourself)<br>
        My enemy (look, look, look, look)<br>
        (Look out for yourself)<br>
        But I'm ready<br>
        <br>
        Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall<br>
        And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called<br>
        I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time<br>
        When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic<br>
        <br>
        Tell you you're the greatest<br>
        But once you turn, they hate us (huh)<br>
        <br>
        Oh, the misery<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        Spare the sympathy<br>
        Everybody wants to be<br>
        My enemy (look, look, look, look)<br>
        (Look out for yourself)<br>
        My enemy (look, look, look, look) (yeah)<br>
        (Look out for yourself)<br>
        <br>
        Uh, look<br>
        Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me<br>
        I'm praying that somebody hope for me<br>
        I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be<br>
        P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions<br>
        Ready to go whenever, just let me know<br>
        The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor<br>
        The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable<br>
        I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"<br>
        They wanna plot on my trot to the top<br>
        I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut<br>
        I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe<br>
        And it matters more because I had it not<br>
        Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition<br>
        Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic<br>
        Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking<br>
        Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic<br>
        Batter, batter up, who the baddest?<br>
        It don't matter 'cause we at your throat<br>
        <br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        Spare the sympathy<br>
        Everybody wants to be<br>
        My enemy<br>
        <br>
        Oh, the misery<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        Spare the sympathy<br>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
        <br>
        Pray it away, I swear<br>
        I'll never be a saint, no way<br>
        My enemy<br>
        Pray it away, I swear<br>
        I'll never be a saint<br>
